# Data Structures and Algorithms

## Overview

This project is a web/desktop application designed to simulate the behavior of nodes and visualize data structures through a graphical user interface (GUI). The application supports the following data structures:

    Trees
    Graphs
    Stacks

## Each data structure will handle a specific number of values:

    Trees: 7 values
    Graphs: 7 values
    Stacks: 6 values

## Project Structure

    Trees: Implementation of tree data structures with operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal.
    Graphs: Implementation of graph data structures with operations such as adding/removing nodes and edges, as well as graph traversal algorithms.
    Stacks: Implementation of stack data structures with operations such as push, pop, and peek.
